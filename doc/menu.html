<H1>TkGoodStuff Menu</H1> 

 <H2> Description </H2> 

<P> The Menu client produces a button that produces a menu.  The menu
is configured within the preferences manager.

<P> Alternatively, the Menu client will not make a button, but will
replace the main tkgoodstuff popup menu as the menu produced by mouse
button 1 on the clock face.

<H2>Configuration</H2> 

<P> In the preferences manager, there is a GUI menu-editing tool, which 
(hopefully) is self-explanatory.

<P> The following items can be added to the menu:

<P> <B>Menu</b> <BR>
This creates a new sub-menu within whatever menu you are currently
defining.

<P> <B>Execute</b> <BR> This creates a menu item to which you give a
label and assign a unix command line to be executed when this item is
selected.

<P> <B>Tcl Command</b> <BR> This creates a menu item to which you give a
label and assign a Tcl command line to be executed when this item is
selected.

<P> <B>tkgoodstuff Menu</b> <BR> This creates a menu item within whatever menu
you are currently defining, which is labelled "TkGoodStuff Menu", and
which produces the tkgoodstuff popup menu when selected.  This is so
that you can get the tkgoodstuff menu even if you replace it with the
Menu client menu on the clock face (by telling the Menu client not to
produce a button).

<P> <B>Separator</b> <BR>
This inserts a horizontal separator line in the menu.

<P><B>Run . . .</B>
This inserts an item in the menu which, when selected, calls up a
dialog window allowing you to enter a unix command to execute.
