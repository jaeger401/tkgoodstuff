 <H2> Description </H2> 

The Clock client is an analog and digital alarm clock and date
display.  It can display any combination of an analog clock, the
(digital) time, and the date.  In combinations, you can choose a
horizontal or a vertical orientation.

<P>

The alarm utility is used by selecting <B>ALARM</B> from the
tkgoodstuff menu and following the simple instructions.  When set, a
little "A" appears in the top left corner of the analog clock frame,
if you are using the analog clock; the color of the font changes if
you are using only the digital clock.  The alarm itself is a beep and
a dialog box containing the message, if any, that you typed in when
setting the alarm.

<P>

If only the time (or only the date) is displayed, you can see the date
(or the time) by entering the clock display briefuly with the mouse pointer.

The Clock also serves as a clicking-point for the tkgoodstuff popup
menu (mouse button 1).
