 <H2> Description </H2> 

The Jots client is a note keeper, intended as a handy tool for keeping
track of scraps of information (e.g., a diary, ftp/URL addresses,
ideas, etc.).  There are much more sophisticated data-base tools,
but Jots is easy enough to invoke and use that you may actually use
it.  The user has any number of "folders" of notes, each of which is
automatically tagged by the date and time it was created.  There is a
"find" utility to find text within a folder, and a "hotlist" mechanism
to quickly maneuver among different folders.

<P>

Jots by default has its own button on the tkgoodstuff panel, but
you can configure it instead to be invoked by pressing mouse button
3 over the Clock.

More help for Jots is available in the "Help" menu of the Jots window.
