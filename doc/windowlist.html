<H1>TkGoodStuff WindowList Client</H1> 

 <H2> Description </H2> 

<P>This is for use with the <a href="http://www.hpc.uh.edu/fvwm/">fvwm2
window manager</a>, when tkgoodstuff is started as an fvwm2 module (see
the documentation for tkgoodstuff's <a href="fvwm.html">Fvwm2</a>
functionality for how to do this).  WindowList produces a window
containing buttons for each open or iconified window on your display
(here's a <a
href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~markcrim/tkgoodstuff/win95.jpg">
screenshot</a>).

<P> The sunken button corresponds to the current (focused) window, and
when a window is iconified, its button is grayed-out.  Clicking mouse
button 1 on a window's button brings the window into focus (even if
it's iconified).  Clicking button 3 iconifies the window.  If the
Pager client is being used, button <2> allows you to "drag" a window
(from its WindowList button) to any page on the display.  If the
buttons fill up the window so that some are out of view, the window
names are abbreviated, and if necessary a scrollbar is created.  If
screen-edge mode is "no", you can adjust the height and width of the
window manually in the preferences manager.

<P> Since this functions as an icon manager, you probably don't want
fvwm2 to post icons.  By default, tkgoodstuff will tell fvwm2 not to
post icons.  But this will affect only windows created after
tkgoodstuff starts up.  So if you normally start other apps (that you
might iconify) before tkgoodstuff, you may want to tell fvwm2 yourself
not to post icons.  In fvwm2.0, the command (in your .fvwm2rc) is:
<pre>Style "*" NoIcon</pre> Be sure to put that AFTER any other Style
lines that define Icon in your .fvwm2rc (except for windows for which
      you do want icons).

All parameters are adjustable in the preferences manager.
