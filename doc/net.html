 <H2> Description </H2> 

The Net client is a dialup (PPP/SLIP/TERM) link status indicator and
up/down toggler.

<P>
Clicking on the Net button instructs the Net client to toggle (open or
close) the network link.

<P>One possible way to have Net open a dial-in link (e.g., ppp or term)
is to use the GUI program <a href="dialer.html">Dialer</a>, which is
included in the tkgoodstuff distribution, to dial your modem and set
up the link.</P>

<P>The client periodically checks whether the link is up or down, and
displays a "lit" up-arrow and/or "Net up", or an "unlit" down-arrow
and/or "Net down" accordingly.  The client checks the line status more
frequently for a while after it executes a command to open or close
the link.

<P> By default, the label on the Net button, when connected, shows the
elapsed time of the connection (up to 24 hours).

<P>
The Net client also can periodically issue a "ping" command, which may
be useful for keeping active a link that the remote host would
disconnect if idle for too long.
<P>

<H2>Invocation</H2> 

All parameters are adjustable in the preferences manager.  

<P> If the default doesn't work (give it a try), you need to specify a
unix command to test whether the net is up (the command should return
successfully (exit status zero) if the net is up, and otherwise.  The
default is

<PRE> ifconfig | grep ppp <\PRE>

You also may need to specify a command to get your IP address if you
want to use the auto-ping feature.  The command should return an
address like "141.211.43.12".  The default is:
<PRE> ifconfig | grep inet.*P-t-P | sed s/inet.*r:// | sed s/P-t-P.*//
<\PRE>
