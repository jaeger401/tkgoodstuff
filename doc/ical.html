 <H2> Description </H2> 

The Ical client is an alarm/calendar utility.  It relies on the
calendar generated by the very nice program <A
HREF="http://clef.lcs.mit.edu/~sanjay/ical.html"> ical</A> for its
information.  The Ical client by default creates its own button
(though it also puts entries in the popup menu and lights up the clock
border to show that it's there, so you can configure it not to
produce its own button).  The Ical client reads your calendar at
user-definable intervals (if it has changed), and posts alarms when
ical would have done so, had you left it running (the point of this
client is to free you from having to do that).  The alarm dialogs have
buttons for launching ical (to read and modify the calendar) and for
selectively or globally stopping alarms.

<P> One of the items the Ical client adds to the popup menu is a
command to list the items for the day (including appointments,
notices, and to-do items).  This command can automatically be run at
startup.
