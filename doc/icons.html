 <H1> Using Icons in TkGoodStuff  </H1> 

The standard buttons (as used by Biff and Net, and the user-defined
Buttons) may contain icons and/or text.  Icons are read in from
files.  To specify an icon, you can give the full path name:
 <PRE>
/usr/include/X11/bitmaps/stopsign.xbm
</PRE>
or just the filename (stopsign.xbm), so long as the file is in a directory in the 
icon path (set in the preference manager, by default to a path
containing just the "icons" subdirectory of the tkgoodstuff librarary
directory and the directory /usr/include/X11/pixmaps).

<P>

What sorts of images can tkgoodstuff handle?  You can use images that
are bitmaps, xpm's, ppm's, and gif's.  More image formats likely will
become "standard" in the future.

<P> 

Formerly, you had to compile an additional package to get xpm image
support.  Now, this functionality is compiled and installed
automatically at tkgoodstuff installation.
