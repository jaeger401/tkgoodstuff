 <H2> Description </H2> 

The TkMan client is launcher for the tkman man-page reader.

<P>

The TkMan button behaves as follows.  Clicking mouse button 1 on the
TkMan button launches tkman (the button stays depressed and
inoperative until you exit tkman).  Button 3 is used to direct tkman
to look up the man page for the word that is the current X selection
(e.g., highlighted with the mouse in some application).  We start
tkman browser unless it's already running; if it's running, we simply
send tkman instructions.
