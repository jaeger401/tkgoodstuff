      <h1>  TkGoodStuff PopImap Utility </h1> 
      
      <a name="function"><h2>Function</h2></a>
      
      <p> The PopImap client automates the fetching of your mail from remote POP
      or IMAP servers to your local machine.  Once the mail is on your local
      machine, you can use any mail reader you like (rather than having to
      make do with one you don't really like that supports the needed client
      protocol). </p>
      
      <p> The client really is little more than a scheduler for a unix
	mail-fetching command that you provide (it is not itself a POP or IMAP
	client; you need to get a mail-fetching client, on which see below).
	You configure the client by telling it what unix command will get your
	new mail from your remote server, and (optionally) what remote command
	will fetch an entire remote mailbox (including old messages), and
	replace a local mailbox with it.</p>
	
      <h3>Interaction with other tkgoodstuff Clients</h3>
      
      <p> One convenient feature is that the Net client knows about PopImap
	and vice versa, so that if both clients are used, PopImap doesn't try
	to check for mail when the Net line is down, and when the Net line
	goes up, Net schedules the periodic PopImap new mail checking to start
	right away (so that your new mail gets to you quickly). </p>
	
      <a name="use"><h2>Use</h2></a>
      
      <p> In the preferences manager you will need to set preferences that
	indicate how frequently to look for new mail on the remote server, as
	well as the unix command that does the looking, and (optionally) the
	unix command that copies the entire remote mailbox over the local one
	(replacing it).  The real work comes in setting up these unix
	commands, which may require finding some programs you don't
	yet have. </p>

      <p> Here I have a decided lack of expertise.  I would very much appreciate
	pointers to stuff I don't know about. </p>
      <ul>
	<li> POP </li></ul>
      <ul>
	<li> "fetchpop".  The author claims it is very stable and
	  feature-rich. Get it at
	  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu in pub/Linux/system/Mail/pop (it's not just
	  for linux). </li>
	<li> "popclient".  Also at sunsite. </li>
	<li> "pop-perl".  Also at sunsite. </li>
      </ul>
      <li> IMAP </li>
      <ul>
	 <li> <a
	    href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap-utils.tar.Z">
	 imapcopy</a>, which requires
	  <a href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/mail/imap.tar.Z">
	    imap.tar.Z</a> to compile.  This utility nondestructively
	    copies all of the remote mailbox, appending all of its
	    messages to your local spool file or other local mailbox
	    (including mh folders!).
	</li>
	<li> imapmove (simply a unix link to imapcopy), which deletes
	all of the remote mailbox after copying as in imapcopy.
	</li>
	<li> I encourage anyone with a little knowledge of C to look
	at the imapcopy utility to get a sense of what's possible with
	a little hacking.  </li>
      </ul>
