Netscape Communicator beta versions (at least up to beta 3).  We'll
become compatible when it works.</b>

 <H2> Description </H2> 

The WWW client is a web browser launcher.

<P> The WWW client can manage just one browser or more than one
browser.  In the preferences manager, you can specify a
space-separated list of browsers (by default, a single browser, namely
your main default tkgoodstuff browser, which by default is netscape).

<UL>
  <LI><B>Single-browser mode:</b> If (as by default) the WWW client
  knows about only one browser (e.g., netscape), the WWW button
  behaves as follows.  Clicking mouse button 1 on the WWW button
  launches your browser program (the button stays depressed and
  inoperative until you exit the mailer program).  Button 3 is used to
  visit the URL that is the current X selection (e.g., highlighted
  with the mouse in some application).  If your browser is supported
  (Netscape and lynx), then WWW starts the browser unless it's already
  running; if it's running, WWW sends the browser instructions to go
  to the selected URL.  This is useful, e.g., for visiting web pages
  that are mentioned in news articles, email, etc. </LI>

  <LI><B>Multi-browser mode:</b></LI> If in the preferences manager
  you give the WWW client a list of browsers such as "netscape lynx
  mosaic chimera hippo tkwww", then you still use buttons 1 and 3 as
  above, except now you'll get a popup menu to choose your browser.
  (For instance, I like lynx for its startup speed and resource usage
  for most things, but I use netscape when I need to see graphics or a
  netscape-specific page.)  </li> </ul>

<p> The WWW client automatically knows what to do for the browsers
lynx (using an xterm) and netscape.  It
launches others fine if they can be started by their name.

<P> Thanks to Seth Golub for the idea of using the X selection in this
way.
