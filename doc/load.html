 <H2> Description </H2> 

<P> The Load client is a system load indicator, which displays a graph of
the current and recent system load and/or a digital display of the
current load.

<P> The graphical display is a histogram drawn to an automatically
adjusting scale.  A "Scale" preference parameter (by default 1) sets
the initial and <b> smallest </b> maximum of the graph.  If the load
exceeds the current maximum, the scale automatically doubles, and a
red "tick" line is drawn to mark the old maximum.  Thus, by default
the tick lines represent loads of 1, 2, 4, 8, and so on (this is less
cluttered than evenly spaced tick lines).  When possible, the graph is
scaled back up.

<P> Clicking mouse button 1 on the Load button (by default) launches
an xterm running "top" (so you can see what's causing the load).

<P>The system load information is obtained from the /proc filesystem
if possible, and otherwise from the "uptime" command.  Load will work
only if the output of the uptime command includes the current system
load as the third from last field on the line (as is standard).  (If
you would prefer to obtain the load some other way, you need to change
the procedure "GetLoad" in the file Load.tcl.)

All parameters are adjustable in the preferences manager.
