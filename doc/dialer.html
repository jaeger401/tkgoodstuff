 <H2> Description </H2> 

Dialer is a stand-alone program that is included in the tkgoodstuff
distibution.  It dials your modem, executes a login script, and
(optionally) issues a command to set up the network (such as a pppd
command).

<P> It USED TO BE that to run Dialer you needed the expectk program,
but no longer (now Dialer runs on basic tcl/tk). </B>

<P>
Dialer expects a Hayes-compatible modem (like nearly all modems sold
these days).
</P>

<P>

The status of the connection-attempt is presented in a dialog box on
the screen.  You see what number is being dialed, what speed you
connect at, and the reason for any failure to connect.

<P>

All settings are configurable in the Settings window (click the
"Settings" button).  You need to set your modem port and port speed,
and the phone number (or list of numbers, or a repeat-dialing script)
you want to dial.  Optionally, you can set one or two modem init
strings and a unix command to execute when successfully connected
(like pppd).  You also can construct a login script.  This is all done
on-line and is self-documenting (use the "Help" menu in the Settings
window).  You save your settings information in a file in the usual
way (with "Save" in the pull-down "File" menu), and you can have
different settings stored in different files.

<P>

At startup you can indicate your settings file and also a command to
run right away (the command "Dial" starts the dialing just like
hitting the "Dial" button.  So, to start dialing right away, you issue
a unix command like this:
<PRE>
Dialer /home/markcrim/.DialSettings Dial
</PRE>

<P> I use Dialer on my Linux home computer, and I do not have access
to any other unix platforms with dial-out modems, so I cannot be sure
this will work on other platforms.  But I have heard good things from 
people on various Unix platforms, so it's worth a try.
