<H1>tkgoodstuff Chooser</H1> 

by Eric Kahler (ekahler@mars.superlink.net)

 <H2> Description </H2> 

Chooser is a simple client which allows the user to restart
tkgoodstuff with a different configuration file, without having to
exit tkgoodstuff.  Choosing a different configuration can be done by
pressing one of a series of buttons which correspond to configuration
files, and/or by selecting a configuration file choice from the
tkgoodstuff menu.

<H2>Invocation and Variables</H2> 

While the Chooser client can be added from the preferences manager,
quite possibly you will want to use it in a panel that contains only
the Chooser client, and so doesn't contain the Clock or the Menu
client, and so offers no way to reach the preferences manager.  Thus,
you might want to configure a configuration file by hand.  Here is an
example (of an entire tkgoodstuff configuration file) that should show
you how to explicitly specify configuration files:

<PRE>-------Configuration-------
TKGSet ChooserList {/usr/local/lib/tkgconfigs/config1 /usr/local/lib/tkgconfigs/config2} 
Client Chooser</PRE>

Here is how to select every file in a given directory:

<PRE>-------Configuration-------
TKGSet ChooserList /usr/local/lib/tkgconfigs 
Client Chooser</PRE>

It is crucial that the first line of the configuration file is as in these
examples (the word "Configuration" with seven dashes on either side).
