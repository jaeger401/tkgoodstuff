 <H2> Description </H2> 

The Webster client directs your web browswer to retrieve
dictionary-definitions over the net.

<P> To use it, highlight a word as the X selection, and click on the
Webster button; if all goes well, you will soon see a popup containing
the definition of the word.

<P> By default, this client produces a button on your tkgoodstuff
panel.  But you can set preferences so that it will not, in which case
you can use the (Tcl) command "WebsterDefine" as a Menu client item.

<P>       You can customize the URL if you have access to a
better dictionary server.  If you know of a web page that has a "form" to fill
out to get a definition, to determine the needed URL you may have to look
at the html source of the page.  Typically, you will want something like:

http://www2.hti.umich.edu/bin/oed/oed-idx.pl?q1=@word@
</PRE>
That's what I use, but I think only University of Michigan people can access
that server.  The Webster default is Merriam-Webster's server:
