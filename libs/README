(README for the libtkg package)

This is an extension to be used with tk8.0, which includes:

  - a tkgbutton and tkgframe extension, with image+text buttons
    (labels, checkbutton, radiobuttons, and menubuttons), as
    well as "tiled" images in frames and buttons (and labels,
    etc.).
  - a tkfvwm extension 
  - an xpm image type extension

The latter two have their own README's.

This package is compiled and installed automatically in the
tkgoodstuff installation process.
