(README for the tkxpm package)

This is an extension to be used with tk4.1

This package implements the image type pixmap for using
xpm pixmap files with tk4.1.

Images are created from either a pixmap file or a pixmap string with:
       image create pixmap p1 -file pixmap.xpm
       or
       image create pixmap p1 -data "...."
       where `p1' is the name of the pixmap to be created and `pixmap.xpm'
       is a name of a xpm file.
