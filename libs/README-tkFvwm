follows:

Hello

    This is my  first attempt to make  a Tcl extension. It  allows the
creation of  FVWM modules under Tcl/Tk.  I've  been looking for such a
thing since I read the note in the "Fvwm Module Interface" document.

The file  tkFvwm.c implements  a new  tcl  command, with the following
syntaxis:

1) fvwm init <out-fd> <in-fd>

   This  command establish   the  communication with  the parent  FVWM
process through the two pipes identified by  the file descriptors. The
<out-fd> is the file descriptor used to send messages *to* FVWM, while
<in-fd>  is the fd  that  receives messages  *from* FVWM. The  typical
usage is:

	fvwm init [lindex $argv 0] [lindex $argv 1]

2) fvwm send <windowID> <message>

    This command  sends  the    given message  to   the  parent  FVWM,
indicating the windowID over wich the command will be applyed. Typical
usage is:

	fvwm send  $id {Iconify ""}
	fvwm send 0 Send_WindowList

3) fvwm <cmd-name> ?<script>?

   This defines  (or  queries) the procedure to  be  called when a  FVWM
message is received.

   <cmd-name>     is one  of      the  following keywords:   DeadPipe,
TogglePaging, NewPage,  NewDesk,  AddWindow, RaiseWindow, LowerWindow,
ConfigureWindow,      FocusChange, DestroyWindow, Iconify,  Deiconify,
WindowName,  IconName, ResClas, ResName, EndWindowlist, IconLocaton or
Map.

   The   matching   is case    insensitive    and the  names  can   be
abreviated.  DeadPipe doesn't correspond to   any FVWM message, but is
invoked when the comunication with the parent  is broken (as when FVWM
dies).

   The script may contain % characters. Each of these, and the
character following it, is replaced with data taken from the FVWM
message as defined in the list below.
  
	%W   window id

	%x   window horizontal pos
	     (also, x coord of bottom-right page in NewDesk message)
	
	%y   window vertical pos
	     (also, y coord of bottom-right page in NewDesk message)

	%w   window width

	%h   window height

	%t   desktop for window

	%f   flags

	%N   window, icon or class name

	%T   current desktop (in a NewDesk message)

	%D   current desktop (in a NewPage message)

	%X   new desk horizontal pos (in a NewPage message)

	%Y   new desk vertical pos (in a NewPage message)

	default:

This list will be extended in the next release. The typical usage is:

	fvwm configureWindow {Configure %W %f}
	fvwm iconName {icon_name %W %N}


I have written   a couple of examples, they   are included in the  tar
file. It is advisable that you make an interpreter with this extension
and TclX and/or Tix  (at least the  Xpm code). If  you want to include
only some of these extensions, you will  need to change the headers of
the file. I've done it on tixImgXpm.c and others.  Feel free to e-mail
me if you want these.
